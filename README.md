### **2. Libraries**
   - Introduction to libraries
   - Creating static & shared libraries
   - Using libraries
   - Managing dynamic libraries

### **3. Process Management**
   - Introduction to program loading
   - Process definition
   - Understanding process address space
   - Kernel process descriptor
   - Introduction to Linux process scheduler

### **4. Stack Analysis**
   - Introduction to stack
   - Stack growth and shrinkage
   - Function parameter passing
   - Stack frame creation and destruction

### **5. Application Programming Interfaces (API)**
   - Understanding need of API
   - API vs system calls
   - User mode/kernel mode transitions
   - APIs and application portability

### **6. Managing Process Address Space**
   - Introduction to virtual address space

   - I/O cache
   - Understanding file descriptors & inode structures

### **8. File I/O Operations**
   - Introduction to common file APIs
   - Accessing file attributes
   - Standard I/O operations
   - File control operations

### **9. Signal Management**
   - Introduction to signals
   - Linux signal types & categories

### **11. Process Creation Calls**
   - Process creation calls (fork, vfork, execve)
   - Monitoring child processes
   - Linux kernel process creation routines
   - Copy-on-write resources
   - Handling child process termination events
   - Linux threads interface (clone)

### **12. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
   - Message Queue
   - Semaphore
   - Shared memory
   - POSIX Threads

These topics are fundamental to **Linux system programming**, forming the foundation for advanced areas like kernel development, device drivers, and embedded Linux.
